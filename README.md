Initial test of importing 3D geometry from Google Tiles into blender then into a DCL scene.

Process is pretty straightforward so far. Start with this tutorial/add on to get google data into blender: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BE65zyZyZ9k

This scene showcases 3 test tiles: Berlin, New Orleans, and Paris, each roughly 320 meters by 320 meters (20 parcels by 20 parcels)

Next Steps: 
 - test deploy to a DCL World
 - expand city scenes by adding additional surrounding tiles
 - develop a method for easily switching between city scenes
 - optimize 3D tiles for file size
 - automating tile .glb creation process if possible
