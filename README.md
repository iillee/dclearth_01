Second test of importing 3D geometry from Google Tiles into blender then into a DCL scene.

Process is pretty straightforward. Start with this tutorial/add on to get google data into blender: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BE65zyZyZ9k

This scene showcases a portion of Venice, Italy (roughly 15%) scaled down to 20%

Next Steps: 
 - expand city scenes by adding additional surrounding tiles
 - expand parcel size of scene, scale avatar size down, or figure out illusion for loading similar to infinity engine
 - scale up tiles to 100%
 - optimize 3D tiles for file size and bake in materials
 - automate tile .glb creation process if possible
